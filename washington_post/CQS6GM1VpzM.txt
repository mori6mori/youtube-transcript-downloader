-I don't want to have
broad generalizations of --
of any group or --
geographic or otherwise,
without that data in --
in front of me.
But I think it's --
it's very clear to us
that for people with two jobs,
um, the economy is
gas and groceries and rent.
Uh, we need to speak
to those issues
if we're going to be the party
that speaks
to our community members
and -- and the people, the
working, um, everyday Americans,
then we need to speak
to those issues.
Uh, and to the extent
that they haven't felt that,
um, we need to do better,
and that's --
that's on us to communicate.
But there will be time in the --
in the weeks ahead
to have more conversations based
on data on what we need to do
or what the path forward is
and what we hear back from --
from our members and --
and our community.
Um, but talking
about those kitchen-table issues
is going to be, you know,
very high on the -- on the list.
Uh, we can
and we will continue to do that.
