-On Georgia Ave
on Howard University's campus.
And we are in line to, you know,
watch Kamala Harris
the night of the election
and, you know, hopefully watch
her win the election
and be the next president
of the United States.
-I'm excited,
overjoyed, slightly anxious.
But we're ready.
-How historic it is.
The first woman president,
the first Black woman president,
who also went to a HBCU,
who was also a member
of the Divine Nine.
I hope it kind of sheds a light
a little bit more on HBCUs in D9
and just the importance
that it has in our lives
and as we matriculate
through our careers
like it has for Kamala Harris.
-I spoke to my mom
this morning.
She's 90 years old.
And to see all of the years
through time,
to have a Black woman
to take the office of presidency
for the United States of America
is very significant.
It is just a moment
that's indescribable.
That's why I needed to be here.
-Well, my grandma was
a civil rights baby,
so she wasn't born
during the time
that she could be able to vote,
nor was her parents.
So I was always taught
at a young age
how important it is to vote
and how important it is
to always be civically engaged,
whether it's a presidential
election or it's state, local.
I hope everything goes safe
across the nation.
I don't want anything --
Regardless of who wins,
there shouldn't be any violence.
It should just be peace,
because that is the whole point
of this presidential election
and democracy.
It should be peace,
and we should learn
how to coexist among each other.
