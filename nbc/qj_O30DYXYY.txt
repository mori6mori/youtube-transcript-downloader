PEOPLE WITH LOVED ONES AT
PROVIDENCE ST JOSEPH IN BURBANK.
IN DISBELIEF AFTER LEARNING THIS
WOMAN, 44 YEAR OLD AMANDA LEAN
PORTER IMPERSONATED A NURSE AT
THE HOSPITAL CARING FOR DOZENS
OF PATIENTS BEFORE SHE WAS FOUND
OUT AND FIRED.
I'M SURPRISED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
I JUST CAME OUT OF THE,
I GUESS THEY WOULD CALL IT
MATERNITY WARD.
AND IF ANYONE WAS IN THERE DOING
THAT, I WOULD JUST BE
BLOWN AWAY. I I TO ME, I'M
SHOCKED WHEN YOU TOLD ME THAT I
REALLY AM
PORTER.
ACCORDING TO BURBANK, POLICE
IMPERSONATED A REAL NURSE WHO
LIVES OUT OF STATE.
PORTER FRAUDULENTLY WORKED AT
PROVIDENCE SAINT JOSEPH
FROM APRIL TO MAY OF THIS YEAR,
CARING FOR ABOUT 60 PATIENTS AND
COLLECTING PAYCHECKS.
POLICE SAY PORTER ALSO COMMITTED
A SIMILAR CRIME AT HENRY MAY
IN VALENCIA.
BOTH HOSPITALS TOLD NBC FOREIGN
STATEMENTS THAT PORTER
WAS IN THE PROBATIONARY OR
ORIENTATION PHASE OF
HER EMPLOYMENT AND WAS PARTNERED
WITH A TRAINING
NURSE DURING ALL THE SHIFTS SHE
WORKED.
THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF IS
HOW IS THIS HAPPENING? HOW IS
THIS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN?
FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER,
ALICE BENJAMIN SAYS THIS STORY
HAS HER CONCERNED
SAYING IT ISN'T EASY TO
IMPERSONATE A NURSE.
WHEN YOU GO TO APPLY,
NEED TO PROVIDE A VERIFICATION
OF YOUR NURSING LICENSE.
UM IN MANY CASES, NOW,
YOU NEED TO PROVIDE EVEN A COPY
OF YOUR DIPLOMA OR YOUR
TRANSCRIPT.
AND SHE SAYS YOU HAVE TO VERIFY
THROUGH COMPETENCY TESTS AND
EVALUATIONS THAT YOU HAVE THE
SKILL SET TO CARE FOR PATIENTS.
WE GO THROUGH RIGOROUS SCHOOLING
PROGRAMS TESTING.
UH WE ARE LICENSED AS NURSES.
NURSE. ALICE SAYS IT MAKES HER
WORRIED
ABOUT THE SECURITY OF HER
NURSING LICENSE,
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE POLICE
BELIEVE PORTER MAY HAVE
COMMITTED
THIS CRIME AT OTHER HOSPITALS IN
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
I'M LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA,
ARIZONA, MICHIGAN AND NEW YORK.
SO I IMMEDIATELY THE STORY
CONCERNED ME BECAUSE HERE I AM
IN CALIFORNIA WORKING. BUT
WHAT IF SOMEONE
KNEW THAT I KNEW MY INFORMATION
AND WENT TO NEW YORK AND
IMPERSONATED ME?
THAT'S SCARY.
