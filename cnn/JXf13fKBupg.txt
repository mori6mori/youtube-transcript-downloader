All right.
Developing this morning reports
that new first best friend
Elon Musk
is starting to irritate
president elect Trump's advisers
during a dinner at Mar-A-Lago, Axios
reports that a heated confrontation
between Musk and Trump adviser
and attorney Boris Epstein.
They write,
quote,
at one point during what the sources
described as a massive blow up,
Musk accused Epstein
of leaking details of Trump's transition,
including a personnel picks to the media.
Epstein responded by telling Musk
that he didn't know
what he was talking about.
This comes amid new reports
that Musk is also becoming
a source of infighting.
The Trump
transition team
surrounding the choice
for Treasury secretary.
Musk is backing
Trump transition co-chair
and fellow billionaire Howard Lutton
for the job,
while Trump's
advisers are pushing for hedge funds.
CEO Scott Bezzant,
the billionaire
not only putting his 2 or $0.10 a hand,
but also asking his more than 200 million
followers to weigh in,
he posted to Twitter.
Quote would be interesting
to hear more people weigh in on this
for real.
Donald Trump to consider feedback.
My view, for what it's worth, is
Bezzant is a business as usual choice,
whereas how
Nick will actually enact
change business as usual is driving
America bankrupt.
We need change one way or another.
With us now
as national political correspondent
for Politico, Meridith McGraw.
You know, it's pretty interesting.
So Musk is in the room where it happens
a lot of time,
but he's also tweeting
from outside the room
trying to influence things.
Well, it's not
just Musk who has inserted himself
into the transition.
It's really Trump's whole,
you know, early kitchen
cabinet here, advisers, people,
Mar-A-Lago members, friends
that are weighing in.
But Musk is spending
a lot of time with Donald Trump
since he got elected.
He's been an ever present,
person at Trump's side, at his club.
He's sitting in on meetings.
He's traveling with him
like he did this weekend
to the professional UFC fight in
New York City.
And he is spending a lot of time
with Trump.
He's giving his insight
and input on some of these picks,
including most recently,
Treasury Secretary,
which is one of the last really big,
remaining cabinet picks
that Trump has yet to announce.
And there's already been some infighting
behind the scenes and jockeying
between different potential candidates,
including Howard Neck,
who is currently co-chair
of Trump's transition,
hedge fund CEO Scott
and and some other dark horse candidates
who have now,
their names have come up
because of this back
and forth and different people
getting involved in the process.
Any sign
that Trump would go against
Musk at this point?
Have we seen an area yet
where the two have disagreed?
Where where Trump won another way?
You know, I don't know about that.
But, you know, certainly Trump is really,
you know, taking his input seriously.
He is keeping him around.
He is involved in in a lot of these,
different meetings.
you know, Musk came with,
Trump to Washington,
DC last week
when Trump on the plane
made the decision
that he was going
to appoint
Matt Gates to as attorney general.
but, you know, other people
who've been around Trump include,
of course, Siouxsie Wiles, Linda McMahon,
who's also co-chairing the transition,
Howard Latin, Nick.
And then a lot of aides and advisers
who are around him as well, too.
All right.
Meredith McGraw from Politico,
thanks so much for being
with us this morning.
