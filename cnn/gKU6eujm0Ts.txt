One of the surprises for Democrats
this election cycle was
just how many Latinos
swung their support to Donald Trump.
My next guest is a Democrat
who bucked that trend
and outperformed
among Latinos in Arizona.
Joining us now
with some advice for his party,
Senator elect Ruben Gallego of Arizona.
You're still a member of the House,
though, right?
I mean, yes, unfortunately.
Is it okay if I call you Congressman,
or do you call the man that I call you
senator or lobby?
Ruben. It's okay.
So, you won in Arizona?
the top of the ticket did not.
What did you do? Right.
And they did wrong.
Well, look,
from the get go,
we understood that
we were already behind the eight ball.
There are 300,000 more registered
Republicans than Democrats.
You need to vote.
We needed to just talk to everybody
as often as possible
and build trust,
because we knew as a very
hard environment people were hurting.
When I say
people were hurting,
people were really felt
the pain of the economy,
of not being to buy what they wanted,
not being able to buy a house,
even get apartments.
And, what we need to do
is make sure people understood
that I felt what they had felt
because I grew up poor,
I understood what they were feeling.
So we went everywhere.
Everywhere in Arizona.
We spoke to everybody
Democrats, Republicans, independents.
We went to the reddest parts
of the state.
We went to
some of the bluest parts of the state
that also never visited.
and we explained to people that,
you know, what that's happening right now
is bad.
And also, by the way,
it's not your fault.
but we're going to work to fix it.
I've heard.
Go ahead.
And, you know, and
and I think that's
the thing that we did for 23 months
that made the biggest difference.
I've heard Democrats complaining.
And this is not Kamala Harris specific,
but I've heard Democrats
complaining that too often Democrats
think that they can say,
oh, don't worry about your pain.
Look at this chart.
Yes. That's true.
And do you think that that was something
that absolutely,
a lot of people were saying that.
And I heard that like, well, talk to me
how good the economy is.
The problem is
you can have all the graphs you want.
If you open up your checking account
and you see that you're making less
and there's not enough coming in,
it doesn't matter
what the GDP growth is, right?
If you go to the grocery store
and I
live in a fairly working class area,
and you start noticing
that the brand names
are not being bought and generics are,
it doesn't matter what unemployment is,
you know, and,
you know, a lot of people got through,
you know, this inflation,
rising inflation.
But I also it out credit card debt.
And so I think people forgot
the whole time
is that even though,
yes, wages were going,
were getting higher,
yes, costs were going down,
people were still paying down
credit card debt that they used basically
to survive this whole time.
And so one of the things
that we were very clear
about in this campaigns, we said, yes,
let's let's see what we can do.
Like, let's figure out what we could do
to make your life a little easier
so you could breathe easier. Right.
And just being able to recognize that,
hey, this is a problem
and not just trying to gloss over it.
I think it was a big, big difference.
Yeah.
Let's talk about the Latino vote,
because obviously that's a where
that's a place that you did well.
It's you know, Donald Trump
didn't win the Latino vote,
but he did better than any Republican
presidential candidate in history.
And according to CNN's
exit poll, 55% of Latino men
voted for him.
That's a 19 point
swing from four years ago.
You say that Democrats
need to, quote,
go touch grass and meet real Latino.
What do you mean by that?
I think Democrats
a lot of times surround ourselves
with people that
will affirm what we already believe,
or people from our same backgrounds.
Right.
And so you have a lot of Ivy League
candidates that hire Ivy League Latinos
that don't actually come
from a working class background, and most
Latinos are actually working class.
And sometimes
we don't want to hear
what they're saying.
And, you know,
I had the benefit of growing up,
you know, in a working class family.
Like, you know, my mom was a secretary.
My father was a bridge.
I grew up,
you know,
it's still even my my whole family,
you know, families were in class.
I actually have it's a big Latino
family, too.
I actually have a really good,
you know, pulse on
what's happening there.
And we don't want to hear the bad news.
And I think a lot of times,
you know,
we knew that
something was bad
with the Latino community
when it comes to their opinion
of the economy.
Yeah, because I'm
very much connected to it.
I think a lot of politicians
didn't want to hear
what's actually happening out there.
And the reason we were successful,
because we heard about it
and we moved early on
in my first campaign
commercial was about the economy
in Spanish and also on the border.
You were our first
commercial was about immigration
and more border security in Spanish
because we heard about it earlier.
I think there's a lot of people in DC
that didn't
want to hear
what the
what was happening out there,
because it would go against
some of their,
you know, some of the stuff
they had learned in the past.
you're a veteran.
and I wanted to ask you,
Trump, has now
President-Elect Trump has nominated Fox
News co-host
and Army National Guard veteran,
Pete Hegseth to to lead the Pentagon.
he has said,
that women should not serve
in combat roles,
and that the Joint Chiefs chairman,
should be fired for being
too, quote, woke.
you deployed to Iraq with the Marines.
are you going to vote for Pete Hegseth
for secretary of defense?
What's your position?
Well, I'm going to give an opportunity
to, number one, explain himself.
and I'll give that to
all these cabinet members.
You know,
the most important things
that I'm going to use
for all the metrics of everybody
that's running
is, number one,
are you going to protect and
and serve the Constitution,
the United States
number two,
is this going to be beneficial
to Arizona?
and are you where relevant,
you know, going to help us
bring down the costs of everything
that's in Arizona?
and the country in general?
so, you know, I'm
not going to jump ahead and say
yes or no, I'll give him his opportunity.
It's part of my constitutional duties.
But, I think he has to answer
for a lot of
what he has said in the past.
you as a veteran, also, I
want to ask you, is one of the ways
Donald Trump won
was by kind of painting himself as
I will keep us out of wars and Democrats,
and their allies like Liz Cheney and Dick
Cheney, they will take you into wars.
what did you make of that argument?
Did that resonate with people?
I'm not sure.
Look, I think really the economy
is what resonated with people.
and that's what I heard, in Arizona,
a lot,
people were worried
about the cost of everything.
And I think some of the frustration
was that we were spending money,
but not necessarily helping people.
And and that's any money like in Ukraine,
you mean? Yeah, exactly.
And, you know,
part of my frustration was like,
we would love
nothing more to help you out,
but also we don't have the votes
from Republicans.
But even getting to that discussion
starts going down. A long conversation.
The biggest lesson
we have to learn here
is when people are hurting economically,
they're going to take care
of themselves first.
And that's
what we've seen for the last,
you know, change elections
for the last 20 years.
And I think it's important
for Democrats, remember that from now on,
you have to take care of people
at the bottom line.
You have to give them
some level of economic security,
especially Latino men, Latino men
believe they can work themselves
out of any problem.
Like, I remember growing up
when I didn't have enough money
to travel back home for Christmas.
I just went and worked
extra hours when you were a marine now
when I was at school.
And so I would,
I literally went to a convention center
and threw on a costume head leaflets.
Right.
That's the mentality
of, of of Latino men.
This is election.
I'm sorry.
This time.
It's the first time
I had ever heard many them say,
I just don't feel like I'm doing anything
to provide for my family.
I don't feel like I'm being, security
until we actually focus on that
and understand
that we're going to have problems,
you know, really
bringing them back
into the Democratic fold.
Senator elect Rubin going to go.
Congratulations again.
and please come back, a lot.
We'd love to have you.
We love hearing from you.
