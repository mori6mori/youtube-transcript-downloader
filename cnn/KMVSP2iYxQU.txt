Now to Donald Trump's
new billionaire bestie.
Since the election, Elon Musk
has spent almost every day
with the president elect.
He's been on the phone with world
leaders, weighed in on
critical cabinet choices at Mar-A-Lago,
even joined Trump's trip
here to Washington yesterday.
Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker
joins me now.
Thank you for being here.
You've done extensive
reporting on Elon Musk.
You wrote about his brazen
and expansive influence on the U.S.
that was before
he became attached
at the hip at the president running.
During the break,
you and I were talking
about
the kind of unprecedented nature of this
very wealthy
private citizen having so much influence.
We were sitting here at the table
trying to think
if there's anything
that even comes close,
like a Rockefeller or JP Morgan or Lewis.
I don't think so. Do you?
Well, in the course of my reporting,
I talked to historians
because I had the same question,
and I looked at all of those examples.
And I talk in that article
that you just showed
about some of the precedents
that maybe could fit the mold.
But the key point here, then,
as I talked to this morning
after a story
and he said,
no, there's really nothing
that comes so close
because when we look at Elon
Musk's government contracts
and they have continued
to proliferate over the past
ten years,
we're talking about nearly
a hundred contracts,
17 agencies that he works
with, on the order of 15 billion
plus in the value of these contrast,
the officials who run
those relationships
are often cowed by Musk.
And these are also incredibly
national security
sensitive areas
of the government's operations.
These are
areas of key infrastructure,
everything from the war in Ukraine,
where his satellite access became
really, really
strategically important
and where DoD officials were telling me,
we can't control
what he's doing in terms of giving
or taking away
that access that Ukrainian forces
had to domestic issues.
We saw recently that he was part
of hurricane
relief
and providing internet access
in areas affected by that,
and he felt very free
and brazen
to criticize government agencies
involved in that
hurricane relief response.
So they really have a bull
in a China shop in this relationship,
and they don't have competitors
to turn to in a lot of cases.
All of that experience told me
is a whole new level
of private influence.
And that's, as you pointed out
before, in recent developments,
where now he is
more and more enmeshed
in a new administration, so enmeshed.
And that's kind of the unofficial
relationship that he has.
And then, of course,
there's the fact that Trump announced
that he and Vivek Ramaswamy would,
be tasked with finding wide ranging
cuts to federal agencies.
I wonder how that is going to
kind of run up against what
you just talked about,
the billions of dollars in U.S.
government contracts that he has.
Well, this is the thing with billions
of dollars of contracts.
And then also this is an individual
and these are companies
that are under extensive investigation
by US law enforcement organs, everything
from the National Highway Transportation
Safety Agency,
to the Department of Justice.
there's a major investigation
that's been ongoing into
whether Musk was fraudulent.
These companies were fraudulent
in their representations
of their self-driving technology,
and there were deaths
that resulted from that technology
in some cases.
this is not to,
you know, demonize in a simplistic way.
These are new technologies.
There's always complicated
regulatory issues around those.
But these are particularly,
important technologies
with life or death stakes.
And the representations
these companies
make are really sensitive.
And he's now positioning himself
to have potential oversight
of the agencies
that are investigating him.
So that's also a brand new phenomenon.
that would be an unprecedented level of,
conflict of interest.
And I think for all of us
in the press
who care about creating accountability
in these relationships
for the American people,
we're going to have our work
cut out for us.
We'll talk about that
because I know accountability.
and you know what
he calls
freedom of the press,
which, you know,
when you actually look at
what has happened
to a place
like a platform like X, formerly Twitter.
and the way that he clearly
has sort of messed
with the algorithms there.
How does what he claims
that he wants comport
with what we have seen that has happened
based on his influence?
Well, it's completely opposite
to the ideologies he's
supposedly espoused all the way along.
When you talked about restoring a balance
of free speech on this platform,
over and over again,
we see analyzes that are credible.
It's not just anecdotal
showing that there's a real rise
in not just all speech and radical speech
on all sides,
but a particular
brand of right wing
extremism and misinformation
on this site.
And the warning signs were all there.
this story
that you mentioned that I worked on
and I profiled Musk
also got into his apparent personal turn
towards right wing radicalism.
And yeah, there's a number of things
in his personal life
he's talked a lot about his relationship
with a trans daughter.
That he has is an origin point to that.
but it all lines up
in this very convenient way
where a figure who had a lot of power,
who was facing scrutiny
from what he now decries
as a liberal outlet and the government
and in the public square
has been able to take control of really
all of that.
He found a way to inject himself into
controlling the discourse
that is quite unprecedented,
to return to that word.
I think it's really merited here.
And he found a way to exercise
what looks very much at this point,
like it might be actual control of a sort
in his ability
to cut the budgets of agencies
that would otherwise be
not just managing his relationships
with the government,
but investigating him. Yeah.
I mean,
we're talking about checks
and balances and total control,
by the Republican Party
here in Washington.
That doesn't even begin to touch,
some of the things
that you're talking about
so important
with regard to how much power
he clearly has.
Ron, and thank you so much
for being here. Appreciate it.
