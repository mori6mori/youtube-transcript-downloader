It's time for, lie-curious.
The rules are simple.
I give you three biographical details
about a public figure,
but only one is true.
You have to guess which one is the truth
and which a dirty, filthy lies.
Let's get started.
Time for three facts about Joe Rogan.
Facts are
he agreed to donate his brain
to the University of Texas.
Draw it away from my Chemical Romance.
Is his cousin.
He said on his podcast
that yogurt causes sterility.
Oh, man.
Number three can't be right,
because that seems too obvious.
That's true. Yeah.
I mean, it's possible
that he agreed to donate his brain
to the University of Texas.
What is not possible
is that they agreed to accept it.
Joe Rogan is the first cousin
once removed.
Or Gerard way from my Chemical Romance.
Here they are. Side by side.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm going to tell
you something right now.
I know a lot of dos.
They draw those similar names
to Gerard, Gerard, Gerard.
The occasional Gerard.
Not one of them.
Looks like that white man on the left.
This looks like Kingpin and the penguin.
Rogan confirmed on this podcast
that Gerard Way's
Jose is his grandmother,
with Rogan adding,
Yeah, I don't know him,
but we're cousins,
which is like the slogan
for every Thanksgiving.
Time for three facts about rock icon
Bob Dylan.
Our facts are
he starred in a Japanese
ad campaign for PlayStation.
He appeared on the episode of Porn Stars.
He sleeps in a hammock instead of a bed.
I am willing this into existence.
He has to have starred
in a Japanese ad campaign for a place
that's totally porn.
You have to have the footage
and we have to watch it.
I am also willing this into existence
because I desperately want to see the Bob
Dylan commercial.
I kind of want to be on porn stars.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, bring in that guitar.
And I go, Now,
this isn't a Bob Dylan guitar.
Is correct.
Wow.
Literally that point to respect for
everyone getting on board.
It's
all coming
back to something that I think
if you're doing business with values
on Black Twitter
for the next three years,
you do not want to end up on a Tim
Burchett campaign.
AG Roy Wood, Junior Love still
air my bullets.
I'm over doing it now.
Bruton and
Tim's correct.
Bob Dylan appeared on a 2010
episode of porn stars
Rick since Chumley on a mission
to the Las Vegas Strip
to track down Bob Dylan for an autograph.
Hey, Mr. Dylan.
How you doing? Okay.
I was wondering if I could trouble you
for a signature.
That's really mean a lot to my boss.
Okay.
Well, thank you, Mr. Ryan.
Good luck to you,
Roy.
If it's good enough for Bob Dylan.
