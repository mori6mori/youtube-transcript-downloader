Steve, update
us on
what we know about these new det
involving Pete
Hegseth, Trump's pick
for a US defense secretary.
Yeah, this is an incident
that first came to light in the 
after Trump
nominated Hegseth
to become his defense secretary.
After a very quick period
where he was considering other n
and suddenly pivoted to Hegseth.
And here's what we are learning 
Texas attorney.
His attorney said
that Texas paid a woman
who accused him of sexual assaul
in a settlement agreement
that also included
a confidentiality clause.
Now, this is all dating back
to an October 2017 incident,
which his lawyer
describes as, quote,
a consensual sexual encounter.
Now, they're also pointing out
and we should point out ourselve
that he was not charged,
this the city of Monterey, Calif
where this took place,
will not be releasing
the full report at this time.
We did try to reach out
to the victim in this case,
and she declined to be interview
partially because she was not su
what she was allowed to authoriz
due to this confidentiality agre
We do not know how much
the settlement was for,
and we are told by the lawyer
that he agreed to this settlemen
because he was worried
about losing his job at Fox News
This all transpired
at the during
the middle of the MeToo movement
in which several Fox News high p
figures were caught up
in some of the accusations Fred.
All right.
Steve Kantor, now, thanks so muc
All right.
Joining me right now
to talk more about Trump's
transition is Tim Mitchell.
She is a Washington corresponden
for the Atlanta Journal Constitu
T a great to see you.
Thanks for having me.
So what
lengths is Trump
going to take
to make sure his picks,
like Gates, can endure scrutiny?
So right now it's looking like h
is a to put pressure on Republic
particularly in the Senate,
both privately and publicly.
He's also floated
the idea of recess appointments,
basically
having the Senate kind of avoid 
on some of these more controvers
Cabinet picks
altogether by allowing Trump
to appoint them
when Congress is not in session.
The question is, will Trump dig 
or will the Senate?
We've heard from top senators,
even Trump allies,
who've indicated
they want to treat
these Cabinet appointees like an
which means hearings,
which means committee stops
before you get to the floor,
which means a vote on the floor.
Who's going to give?
Because we know that
when you bring some of
these more controversial picks
like Gates, like Head
said,
there might not be the votes
to confirm them.
We don't know what Trump would d
but we also don't know
if there are enough Republicans
who are willing to go against
who Trump wants to serve on his 
and actually vote against
Trump appointees.
Oh, we'll get to a little bit of
in a minute, too.
And I wonder,
you know, your thoughts on this.
You know,
because earlier today, House Spe
Mike Johnson
told our Jake TAPPER
the House Ethics
Committee report on Gates
should not be released
because Gates resigned Congress
so is it the case potentially th
Senate will subpoena the report,
or at least the committee will
subpoena the report?
So that's another
question about
whether there are Republicans
who are willing to side
with Democrats, for example,
to vote to subpoena the reports,
to bring Matt Gaetz in for heari
and questioning
what other people
they might want to hear from.
You know, there have been
you know, there's precedent
for confirmation hearings to bri
you know, other
other speakers, other
witnesses like witnesses, Eric?
The witnesses.
Yes, we've seen that with Suprem
justice confirmations.
So there are other things
they could do in addition
to trying to get their hands
on the report.
Again, the
to me, the big question
is, are there Republicans
who are willing to risk
getting on Trump's bad side by,
you know,
pushing back on these appointees
by pushing to get that report?
There's also a question, quite f
the more people ask for the repo
the the
the more pressure of a possibili
it looks.
Right. Right. Okay.
And so now more on the
who will side with whom.
You know,
maybe this is another
little window into that
because this morning on the Sund
talk shows,
a few members of Congress descri
you know,
both the landscape on Capitol Hi
and navigate 88
under the incoming administratio
Take a listen.
We have a unified
government now because of Donald
Trump.
No one else, Donald J.
Trump made that happen.
And so now it is incumbent
upon the House of Representative
and the Senate to look
at President Trump's agenda
and his mission statement.
He's going to have a mission sta
and we do not waiver
of that mission statement.
We follow it every single word o
These people are
manifestly unqualified and, you 
they're not prepared to run
the very complicated organizatio
they've been asked to run.
Well,
the Republican senator
who votes to confirm Matt Yates 
Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard
will be remembered by history
as somebody
who completely gave up
their responsibility to to Donal
Wow. Huh.
So, I mean,
will this be a test of allegianc
country or President?
I guess in some ways, yes.
But again, we've been here befor
We've seen highly controversial 
be confirmed
by members of the president's pa
And some people felt that
it hurt them at the ballot box,
other others didn't.
And so I
you know,
I think one of the question
is of the senators that we know
may have their concerns
about a pick
like Matt Gaetz, for example,
which ones are willing to actual
against him.
Those are two very different thi
But they're not just factoring i
how they feel about Matt Gaetz
and how they feel about Presiden
Some of these senators
will be on the ballot in 2026,
so they're factoring in
how this will play back home.
Some of them are in states
where voting against Trump
may play poorly.
Some of them may be in states
where voting against Trump
actually helps them
come across as independent minde
So all of that is kind of
part of the calculus.
That's why Trump has said, Hey,
don't vote at all.
Just let me appoint
who I want during the recess.
Now, that also carries risks.
You know,
it's a lot on the senator's plat
and we're just going to have to 
where it shakes out.
We're going to see which senator
are the ones to watch
who may block the system.
Okay.
One last question.
House Minority Leader
Hakeem Jeffries acknowledges
there will be challenges,
but he remains focused on import
issues. Take a listen.
I've congratulated
incoming President Donald Trump,
and as House Democrats,
we look forward to working
with the incoming administration
whenever and wherever possible
to find bipartisan common
ground to solve problems
for the American people.
That's what
the American people want us to d
to deliver real results
on the issues that matter.
But at the same period of time,
we will continuously push back
against far right extremism.
Whenever necessary,
we will protect Social Security.
We will protect Medicare.
We will protect the Affordable C
We will protect reproductive fre
and we will protect the progress
that we've made
on having a sustainable planet.
How will this test
the unity of Democrats?
Yeah, I mean, I will say that,
you know,
for the past two cycles where we
this past the past
two years, I'm sorry,
where Democrats have been
in the minority,
they've shown
that they have been able to stay
Republicans are the one who stru
to keep their slim majority
all on one page,
all with the same message.
Now, I do think under Trump, Rep
will look a little bit more unif
I think the question now
will Democrats remain patient an
on one accord
as they remain in the minority?
I think people are willing
to give Hakeem Jeffries time
because they do understand
that, you know, he's in line
to become the first black
speaker of the House.
He's with a new kind of leadersh
that, again, has only been in po
about two years.
But I do think
there could be some restlessness
if members,
the Democrats are in the minorit
for much longer.
They're hoping to change that,
of course, in the midterms in 20
All right,
Mitchell, we'll leave it there.
Great to see you. Thanks so much
